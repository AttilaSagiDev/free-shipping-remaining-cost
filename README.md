# **Magento 2 Free Shipping Remaining Cost Extension** #

[![M2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/AttilaSagiDev/free-shipping-remaining-cost/actions/workflows/codesniffer-actions.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/AttilaSagiDev/free-shipping-remaining-cost/actions/workflows/codesniffer-actions.yml)

## Description ##

The extension adds functionality to show the remaining amount that must be spent by the customer to gain free shipping. The extension will display the notification in a block if the free shipping method is enabled, and it has the appropriate minimum order amount (not zero). The module can be configured to set custom amount for calculation, and this will be used instead of the default free shipping order value in this case. If the customer adds products to the cart, the notification will refresh automatically (without page reload). The update also happens for any other interactions if the user removes, modify or update items in the cart.

The administrator can customize the notification text and the block title at the extensionâ€™s configuration panel. The extension can be configured to display the message on the cart page automatically. The administrator can setup the module to show the information box automatically in custom positions like in the sidebar area, content area or almost anywhere on the frontend.

The extension has widget option too with two templates, so it's easy to place the notification block or only the message on cms pages or static blocks. Using the Magento 2 widgets functionality, it's very simple to display the block in different areas. If free shipping available for the customer there is an option to show a customizable success message. This promotional tool will attract more attention.
